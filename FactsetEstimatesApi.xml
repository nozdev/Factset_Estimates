            The type of actual returned. The following is returned:   * **Company Actual**. This is collected directly from a company’s press release for the corresponding past period.    * **European Actual**. This is also collected directly from a company&#39;s press release before January 2017 for European countries. However, **Company Actual ** is used from 2017 onwards to fetch actual irrespective of country or listing.   * **Broker Actual**. A broker actual is a median consensus that can be updated up to 100 days post the fiscal period’s report date. Broker actuals are a post-event only consensus if a report date is collected from an earnings release, unless no brokers have contributed to the post-event consensus yet, in which case the broker actual will be a pre-event consensus.  The broker actual is a pre and post event consensus if the report date is a calculation  For more details on the actual types, visit [Online Assistant Page #13379](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/13379).

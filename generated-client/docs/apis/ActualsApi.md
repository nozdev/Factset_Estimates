### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| **ids** | [**List&lt;string&gt;**](string.md) | Security or Entity identifiers. Accepted inputs include FactSet Identifiers, tickers, CUSIP, and SEDOL. &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance Note:&lt;/b&gt; Requests that increase the number of metrics or request long historical data may trigger the 30-second service timeout threshold. To ensure system stability and performance, please keep requests lightweight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If requesting long historical data, limit the history to &lt;b&gt;10 years per metric per ID&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  |  |
| **metrics** | [**List&lt;string&gt;**](string.md) | Requested metrics. Use the &#x60;/metrics&#x60; endpoint to return a list of available estimate items. **Top 10** most used metrics are **EPS, SALES, DPS, EBITDA,EBIT, PRICE_TGT, CFPS, BPS, NET_INC, and ASSETS**.  For more details, visit [Online Assistant Page #15034](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/15034).  |  |
| **relativeFiscalStart** | **int** | Relative fiscal period, expressed as an integer, used to filter results. This is combined with the periodicity parameter to specify a relative estimate period. FactSet Estimates Actuals provides data for past periods. Therefore, the input for &#x60;relativeFiscalStart&#x60; must be an integer that is zero or less. For example, set to 0 and periodicity to ANN to ask for the current reported year (FY0).  | [optional]  |
| **relativeFiscalEnd** | **int** | Relative fiscal period, expressed as an integer, used to filter results. This is combined with the periodicity parameter to specify a relative estimate period.Therefore, the input for &#x60;relativeFiscalEnd&#x60; must be an integer that is zero or less.  For example, set to -2 and periodicity to ANN to ask for two fiscal years before the latest (FY-2). | [optional]  |
| **periodicity** | **string** | The periodicity for the estimates requested, allowing you to fetch Quarterly, Semi-Annual, Annual, and NTMA/LTMA Estimates.   * **ANN** - Annual   * **QTR** - Quarterly   * **SEMI** - Semi-Annual    * **NTMA** - Next-Twelve-Months - Time-weighted Annual. Estimates use a percentage of annual estimates from two fiscal years to create an estimate based on the 12-month period. Visit [OA 16614](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/16614) for detail.   * **LTMA** - Last-Twelve-Months - Time-weighted Annual. Estimates use a percentage of annual estimates from two fiscal years to create an estimate based on the 12-month period. Visit [OA 16614](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/16614) for detail.     | [optional] [default to ANN] |
| **currency** | **string** | Currency code for adjusting the data. Use &#x60;ESTIMATE&#x60; as input value for the values in Estimate Currency. For a list of currency ISO codes, visit [Online Assistant Page #1470](https://oa.apps.factset.com/pages/1470). | [optional]  |

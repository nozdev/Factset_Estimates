*              Follow these manual steps to construct tests.
*              This file will not be overwritten.
*  *********************************************************************************
* 1. Navigate to ApiTests.Base.cs and ensure any tokens are being created correctly.
*    Take care not to commit credentials to any repository.
*
* 2. Mocking is coordinated by ApiTestsBase#AddApiHttpClients.
*    To mock the client, use the generic AddApiHttpClients.
*    To mock the server, change the client's BaseAddress.
*
* 3. Locate the test you want below
*      - remove the skip property from the Fact attribute
*      - set the value of any variables if necessary
*
* 4. Run the tests and ensure they work.
